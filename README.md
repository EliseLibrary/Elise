Elise Library
=============

Elise is a frontend library with a bunch of tools and componentes to create elegant web applications easily. At the moment we are working on this project so hard! We hope to release an stable version in a few months. Meanwhile you can see some test examples in /test/test.html. And the documentation will be in [http://elise.github.io/](http://elise.github.io/).

Coming soon!
